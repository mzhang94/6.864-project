 An old man who runs a secondhand store in the prole
district. Kindly and encouraging, Mr. Charrington seems to share
Winstons interest in the past. He also seems to support Winstons
rebellion against the Party and his relationship with Julia, since he
rents Winston a room without a telescreen in which to carry out
his affair. But Mr. Charrington is not as he seems. He is a member
of the Thought Police.
