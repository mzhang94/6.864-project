 A beautiful seventeen-year-old who introduces Montag
to the worlds potential for beauty and meaning with her gentle
innocence and curiosity. She is an outcast from society because
of her odd habits, which include hiking, playing with flowers, and
asking questions, but she and her (equally odd) family seem genuinely
happy with themselves and each other.
