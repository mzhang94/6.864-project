The rector of Broxton, the confidante of Captain
Donnithorne. Mr. Irwine is tolerant and compassionate. Although
he is a religious man, he believes that little good is done by chastising
people for their wrong-doings. Instead, he teaches patience and gentleness.
Mr. Irwine has never married and prefers to live with his mother
and two sisters. Although he does not pry into others inner lives,
he offers sage advice when his advice is sought. He loves Captain Donnithorne
like a son and is deeply wounded by Hettys disgrace. Mr. Irwine
knows the details of the lives of the people in the parish and does
his best to encourage what he believes will make them happy.
