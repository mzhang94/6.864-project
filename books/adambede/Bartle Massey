                The
schoolteacher and Adams best friend. Unbeknownst to his friends,
not only does Mr. Massey care deeply for his students, but he exhibits
a patience with them that he seldom shows in the company of friends.
Mr. Massey rails against the stupidity of women and says everything
twice. During Hettys trial, he is a tactful comfort to Adam because
he is able to see when it is best not to speak.
