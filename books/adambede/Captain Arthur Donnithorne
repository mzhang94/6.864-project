A young regimental soldier, heir to the Chase. His
arrogant belief in his own good character leads him to disgrace
Hetty. Captain Donnithorne believes that he is fundamentally a good man,
no matter what else happens and even when events show that his evil
actions have consequences. He tries to buy his way out of every
situation. Even his desire to do good is really a desire to be seen
by others as one who does good. Captain Donnithorne cares for Adam,
although not enough to tell him the truth about Hetty. Although
he loves Hetty, his love is not strong enough to break the class
boundaries that separate them.
