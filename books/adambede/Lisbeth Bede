                The
mother of Adam and Seth, the wife of Thias. Lisbeth shrieks at her
children, complains incessantly about the wrongs the world does
to her, and wishes for death when her husband dies. For all that,
she loves Adam and Seth, although she favors Adam over Seth and
never spares Seths feelings on the subject. She is the first to
remark on Adam and Dinahs love for each other.
