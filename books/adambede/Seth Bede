                Adams
brother, a Methodist carpenter. Seth gives freely of himself, even
to the point of giving up his love of Dinah when he believes it
is for the good of others. Although Seth is not as intelligent as
Adam, he is motivated by love and acts well in all things as a result. Both
gentle and kind, he is comparable to Dinah but lacks her education
and intelligence. A bit of a dreamer, Seth likes to sit and think
rather than do, although he works very hard at his job as well.
