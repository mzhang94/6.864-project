king of the Latins, the people of what is now central Italy, around
the Tiber River. Latinus allows Aeneas into his kingdom and encourages
him to become a suitor of Lavinia, his daughter, causing resentment
and eventually war among his subjects. He respects the gods and
fate, but does not hold strict command over his people.
