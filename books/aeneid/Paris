                    A
Trojan prince, son of Priam and Hecuba, and brother of Hector. The
handsomest of men, Paris is asked to judge which goddess is most
beautiful: Venus, Juno, or Minerva. Venus promises him Helen as
his wife in exchange for his judgment, so Paris selects Venus. This selection
inspires the permanent wrath of Juno against the Trojans. Stealing
Helen from her Greek husband, Menelaus, Paris provokes the Trojan
War.
