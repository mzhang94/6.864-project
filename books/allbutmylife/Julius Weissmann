Gerdas father, referred to as Papa. Despite his illness, Julius
does not complain and does what little he can to make the lives of his family
better. Although he lives only through Part One of the book, Gerda constantly
thinks about him and prays for his survival. She believes that he is responsible
for saving her life, first by insisting that she wear her skiing boots before
she left on the transport and then by making her promise that she would not kill
herself.
