      Don Hector Rocha y Villareal is the owner of the hacienda, or ranch, where John Grady Cole and Rawlins find work. Don Hector, a member of the Mexican aristocracy, is intelligent and cultured, seeming both practical and kind. He is impressed by Cole, and promotes him to the position of breeder. But when he discovers that Cole has been having an illicit affair with his daughter Alejandra, Don Hector is unforgiving, turning the Americans over to the lawless Mexican police. It is for fear of losing Don Hector's love--as well as for fear of her scheming great-aunt Alfonsa's manipulative power- -that Alejandra abandons Cole.
