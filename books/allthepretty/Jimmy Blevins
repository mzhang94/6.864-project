      A thirteen-year-old runaway who follows John Grady Cole and Rawlins to Mexico. His real name, which is not Blevins, is never revealed. He is hypersensitive to mockery and insult, anything impinging on his dignity. This sensitivity led him to run away from his abusive stepfather, and it also leads to his death: he returns to reclaim his stolen horse and gun, and is captured and eventually executed by the cruel captain.
