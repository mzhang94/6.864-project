      A sixteen-year-old man; the central figure inAll the Pretty Horses.We know almost nothing about Cole's physical appearance, only that by the end of the novel he is badly scarred across the face and chest. Laconic and pensive, he seems prematurely aged. He lives his life according to a strict, almost ritualistic code, valuing honor, intelligence, responsibility, justice, loyalty, and skill. Above all other things, he loves horses, with which he is preternaturally gifted, and the cowboy life, the solitude and dignity of the West. The novel follows Cole's journey as he flees the Texas ranch on which he grew up and travels with his companions Rawlins and Blevins south into Mexico; on a psychological level, it depicts what happens to Cole's romantic vision of the West.
