      We never learn the name of John Grady Cole's father. At the beginning of the novel, Cole's father is dying, possibly of lung cancer (although we never find out for certain). The father was a prisoner of war during World War II, and came back from it a changed man; afterward, he and John Grady's mother--a flighty, promiscuous women who ran off to become an actress--were never reunited. He is a lonely, silent man.
