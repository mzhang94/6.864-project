      John Grady Cole's nameless mother appears only in the opening pages of the novel, and only briefly. John Grady's mother has divorced John Grady's father; their marriage was never strong, and for a while during his infancy and early childhood, John Grady's mother left him to be raised by Louisa. At the time the narrative begins, John Grady's mother is only thirty-six years old, and wants to start another life away from the solitude of the ranch, which has become lonely and unprofitable. She and her son are virtual strangers.
