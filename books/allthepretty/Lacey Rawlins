      Lacey Rawlins is John Grady Cole's best friend and his companion on the trip into Mexico. We know little about Rawlins physically, just that at age seventeen he is tall and thin, with long arms. Rawlins is louder, more impatient and less introspective than Cole; he is also the less intelligent and less skilled member of the partnership. While he is faithful to Cole, he does not subscribe to Cole's code of absolute loyalty and strictly moral action, and he lacks the iron will that drives Cole to tirelessly pursue his romantic dreams. Rawlins and Cole stick together until their ordeal in the Mexican jail: afterwards, Rawlins returns to Texas.
