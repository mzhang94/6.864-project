Madame Marie de Vionnets charming and beautiful
daughter. Jeanne is impressively refined but lacks maturity. She
has great fondness for Chad, but not romantic love. He and Madame
de Vionnet play up Jeannes merits in an effort to distract Strether
from the truth of their relationship. Strether sees the well-raised Jeanne
as proof of Madame de Vionnets virtue and suitability.
