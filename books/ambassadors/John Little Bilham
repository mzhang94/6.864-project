An expatriate artist and one of Chads closest friends
in Paris. Because he is physically small, he uses both of his last
names and goes by little Bilham. A friendly, unpretentious young
man, he maintains his loyalty to Chad even as he develops a close
bond with Strether. Ultimately, little Bilham lies to Strether about the
nature of Chads relationship with Madame de Vionnet to protect
Chad. Strether finds Bilham to be gentle and treats him like the
adult son he never had. Their conversations prompt Strether to articulate
some of the most profound life lessons he has learned in Europe.
