The protagonist of the novel. A55-year-old
editor of an intellectual magazine in Woollett, Massachusetts, Strether
has a mustache and a gray-speckled full head of hair and he wears
glasses. Strether is engaged to Mrs. Newsome, a wealthy widow who funds
the magazine he edits. A widower himself, Strether lost his wife
and young son many years ago. He feels guilty about these loses
and wonders what life experience he has missed by not having a wife
or child. Mrs. Newsome has sent Strether to Paris to find her son,
Chad Newsome, and bring him back to Massachusetts. Once he returns
with Chad, she will marry Strether. She chose Strether as an ambassador not
only because he is an old, trusted family friend but also to test
his loyalty to the Newsome family. If he were to marry Mrs. Newsome,
Strether would come into a great fortune and secure his status in
the upper-class community in Woollett. To some degree, Mrs. Newsome
wants to make sure that Strether is worthy of both the wealth and
the social status.
Compulsively self-reflexive, Strether quickly realizes that
his life in Woollett has entrenched him in boring routine. As he
travels, Strether comes to appreciate the freedom and openness he
finds in Europe, and he begins to feel as if his new, full European
life makes up for many years of personal stagnation. Strether takes
to warning everyone he meets that they may turn out like himold
and inexperiencedif they do not live life to the fullest while
they are young. Strether is predisposed favorably toward most people:
he finds a close friend in Maria Gostrey, a type of protg in little
Bilham, a replacement son in Chad, and a feminine ideal in Madame
Marie de Vionnet. At the end of the novel, Strether chooses to return
to Woollett, but his outlook on life is forever changed by his late-in-life
experience in Europe.Read anin-depth analysis of Lewis Lambert Strether.
