                The
of-the-minute society girl in Woollett, Massachusetts. Strether
finds Mamie to be as physically beautiful as the girls in Europe,
as well as more sincere and sociable than most Woollett society girls.
Mrs. Newsome hopes Mamie will marry Chad. To Mrs. Newsome, the fact
that Mamie is Jim Pococks sister, and thus already technically
part of the family, only makes her more desirable. Mamie has known Chad
since childhood, but no romance exists between them. While in Europe,
Mamie falls for little Bilham.
