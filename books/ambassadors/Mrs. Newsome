                An
older, widowed, wealthy matriarch to whom Strether is engaged. Even
though Mrs. Newsome never actually appears in the novel, she drives
the novels action and its significant events. She sends Strether
to Europe to collect her son, Chad, and return him to the family
business in the United States. When Strether fails in his ambassadorial
mission, she sends new ambassadors: her daughter, Sarah; her daughters husband,
Jim; and Jims sister, Mamie. Mrs. Newsome represents the world
of Woollett, Massachusetts, and the life that Strether has left
behind. Strether thinks constantly about Mrs. Newsome, and she occupies
a large place in his conscience, since she asked Strether to carry
out her wishes in Europe and Strether has failed to do so for complicated
reasons. Through Strethers eyes, Mrs. Newsome is beautiful but
deliberately so, wise but incredibly stubborn, and kind but undeniably dominant
in relation to him. The interplay between Mrs. Newsomes wishes
and Strethers evolving needs often drives the novel.
