      The novel's hero and protagonist. Newman is a "superlative American": tall, pleasant, temperate, liberal, athletic, independent, and directa self- made success full of the "easy magnificence of his manhood." Forced to earn a living at a young age, Newman has accumulated a substantial fortune through a combination of diligence and luck. Now forty-two, he travels to Paris to enjoy the fruits of his labors and to find a wife to complete his fortune. He is simple in some respects, inquisitive but interested only in "the best" of any genreas evidenced by his opening marathon tour of the Louvrenot out of elitism, but rather a genuine curiosity to see what others consider superlative. Newman is curious at, but unimpressed with, the intricate Parisian social systeman attitude that causes him trouble.

His moral reasoning, honest love, and unfailing allegiance mark him as mature, consistent and self-aware, even out of his element.Read anin-depth analysis of Christopher Newman.
