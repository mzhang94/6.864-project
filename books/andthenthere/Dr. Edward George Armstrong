 A gullible, slightly timid doctor. Armstrong often
draws the suspicion of the other guests because of his medical knowledge.
He is a recovering alcoholic who once accidentally killed a patient
by operating on her while drunk. Armstrong, while professionally
successful, has a weak personality, making him the perfect tool
for the murderer. He has spent his whole life pursuing respectability
and public success, and is unable to see beneath peoples exteriors.
