                 An
old, ruthlessly religious woman who reads her Bible every day. The
recording accuses Emily Brent of killing Beatrice Taylor, a servant
whom she fired upon learning that Beatrice was pregnant out of wedlock. Beatrice
subsequently killed herself. Unlike the other characters, Emily
Brent feels convinced of her own righteousness and does not express
the slightest remorse for her actions.
