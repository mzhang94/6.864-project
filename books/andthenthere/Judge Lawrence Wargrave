A recently retired judge. Wargrave is a highly intelligent
old man with a commanding personality. As the characters begin to
realize that a murderer is hunting them, Wargraves experience and air
of authority make him a natural leader for the group. He lays out
evidence, organizes searches, and ensures that weapons are locked
away safely. Wargraves guilt is revealed at the end of the novel
in a confession that illuminates the characteristics that drive
him to commit the series of murders: a strong sense of justice combined
with a sadistic delight in murdering.
