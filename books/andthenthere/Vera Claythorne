A former governess who comes to Indian Island purportedly
to serve as a secretary to Mrs. Owen. Vera wants to escape a past
in which she killed a small boy in her care, Cyril Hamilton, so
that the man she loved would inherit Cyrils estate. Although the
coroner cleared her of blame, Veras lover abandoned her. Vera is
one of the most intelligent and capable characters in the novel,
but she also suffers from attacks of hysteria, feels guilty about
her crime, and reacts nervously to the uncanny events on the island.
