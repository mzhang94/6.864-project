A former police inspector. Blore is a well-built
man whose experience often inspires others to look to him for advice.
As a policeman, he was corrupt and framed a man named Landor at
the behest of a criminal gang. On the island, he acts boldly and frequently
takes initiative, but he also makes frequent blunders. He constantly
suspects the wrong person, and his boldness often verges on foolhardiness.
