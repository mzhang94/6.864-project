                The
vain, flighty mare who pulls Mr. Joness carriage. Mollie craves
the attention of human beings and loves being groomed and pampered.
She has a difficult time with her new life on Animal Farm, as she
misses wearing ribbons in her mane and eating sugar cubes. She represents
the petit bourgeoisie that fled from Russia a few years after the
Russian Revolution.
