 A wealthy and dashing military officer whose love
for Anna prompts her to desert her husband and son. Vronsky is passionate
and caring toward Anna but clearly disappointed when their affair forces
him to give up his dreams of career advancement. Vronsky, whom Tolstoy
originally modeled on the Romantic heroes of an earlier age of literature,
has something of the idealistic loner in him. Yet there is a dark
spot at the core of his personality, as if Tolstoy refuses to let
us get too close to Vronskys true nature. Indeed, Tolstoy gives
us far less access to Vronskys thoughts than to other major characters
in the novel. We can never quite forget Vronskys early jilting
of Kitty Shcherbatskaya, and we wonder whether he feels guilt about
nearly ruining her life. Even so, Vronsky is more saintly than demonic
at the end of the novel, and his treatment of Anna is impeccable,
even if his feelings toward her cool a bit.
