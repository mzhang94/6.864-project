Stivas wife and Kittys older sister. Dolly is one
of the few people who behave kindly toward Anna after her affair
becomes public. Dollys sympathetic response to Annas situation
and her guarded admiration for Annas attempt to live her life fully
hint at the positive aspects of Annas experience. Well acquainted
with the hardships of matrimony and motherhood, Dolly is, more than
anyone else in the novel, in a position to appreciate what Anna
has left behind by leaving with Vronsky. The novel opens with the
painful revelation that Dollys husband has betrayed her, and her
even more painful awareness that he is not very repentant.
