(Kitty)-
                 A beautiful young woman who
is courted by both Levin and Vronsky, and who ultimately marries
Levin. Modeled on Tolstoys real-life wife, Kitty is sensitive and
perhaps a bit overprotected, shocked by some of the crude realities
of life, as we see in her horrified response to Levins private
diaries. But despite her indifference to intellectual matters, Kitty
displays great courage and compassion in the face of death when
caring for Levins dying brother Nikolai.
