 Levins sickly, thin brother. The freethinking Nikolai
is largely estranged from his brothers, but over the course of the
novel he starts to spend more time with Levin. Nikolai is representative of
liberal social thought among certain Russian intellectuals of the
period; his reformed-prostitute girlfriend, Marya Nikolaevna, is
living proof of his unconventional, radically democratic viewpoint.
