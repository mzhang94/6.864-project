Annas brother, a pleasure-loving aristocrat and
minor government official whose affair with his childrens governess nearly
destroys his marriage. Stiva and Anna share a common tendency to
place personal fulfillment over social duties. Stiva is incorrigible,
proceeding from his affair with the governesswhich his wife, Dolly, honorably
forgivesto a liaison with a ballerina. For Tolstoy, Stivas moral
laxity symbolizes the corruptions of big-city St. Petersburg life
and contrasts with the powerful moral conscience of Levin. However,
despite his transgressions, the affable Stiva is a difficult character
to scorn.
