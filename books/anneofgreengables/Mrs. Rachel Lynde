The town busybody. Mrs. Rachel likes nothing better
than to give her opinion and preach morals. She lives next door
to Green Gables with her meek husband, Thomas, and an affectionate, quarrelsome
friendship exists between her and Marilla. Mrs. Rachel is outspoken
about everything from politics to fashion, and, although childless,
she never fails to advise Marilla on how to raise Anne.
