of the youngest of the many Gillis girls. Ruby has learned about
growing up from her older sisters, and loves to share her superior
knowledge with Anne and their other friends. Ruby inclines toward sentimentality
and hysterical fits. She cares more for her good looks and her string
of boyfriends than she does for her studies.
