      Annie's father is a kindly, quiet man who is always pleasant to Annie and in the household sphere. While he is kind, the household runs according to his presence. His wife wakes up early to prepare food for him and she cooks for him throughout the day. Before marrying Annie's mother, her father slept with other women and even fathered their children. These women occasionally harass Annie's mother on the street. This legacy of philandering suggests his previous sexual freedom. He is approximately thirty years older than Annie's mother and now has conveniently retired to a life of quiet domesticity. Although he appears to be a kind man, his presence carries subtle undertones of the unequal power relations between genders in the Antigua of Annie's childhood.
