      Annie's best friend in school. Annie uses her relationship with Gwen to fill the void she feels after her mother appears to betray her. Gwen and Annie become inseparable and share their secrets and stories with one another. At the same time, Annie senses that their friendship lacks something since the two girls cling to each other primary because of separation anxiety. After Annie's illness, when she craves rather than fears separation, Annie realizes that her connection with Gwen is not very meaningful. Gwen's docility and willingness to conform to the social order handed down by the colonial power makes her dull in Annie's eyes.
