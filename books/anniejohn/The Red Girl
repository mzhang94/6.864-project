      A local lower class girl whom Annie befriends. The Red Girl's life is as unstructured as Annie's is structured and Annie wants to be like her. The Red Girl only has to wash and comb her hair once a week and is allowed to run wild without parental control. Annie becomes a bit of a hooligan herself after befriending the Red Girl. They are frequently playing marbles, lying constantly, and being a petty thief. The Red Girl stands as a fully defiant character who refuses to live according to the norms that the colonial society imposes on her. She has not been indoctrinated by the English social order because she does not seem to attend school.

Annie's willingness to interact with the Red Girl demonstrates her own desire for defiance against the dominant social order.Read anin-depth analysis of The Red Girl.
