                 Lenina
Crownes friend (they have the same last name because only about
ten thousand last names are in use in the World State). Fannys
role is mainly to voice the conventional values of her caste and
society. Specifically, she warns Lenina that she should have more
men in her life because it looks bad to concentrate on one man for
too long.
