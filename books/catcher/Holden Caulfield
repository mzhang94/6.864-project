The protagonist and narrator of the novel, Holden
is a sixteen-year-old junior who has just been expelled for academic
failure from a school called Pencey Prep. Although he is intelligent
and sensitive, Holden narrates in a cynical and jaded voice. He
finds the hypocrisy and ugliness of the world around him almost
unbearable, and through his cynicism he tries to protect himself
from the pain and disappointment of the adult world. However, the
criticisms that Holden aims at people around him are also aimed
at himself. He is uncomfortable with his own weaknesses, and at times
displays as much phoniness, meanness, and superficiality as anyone
else in the book. As the novel opens, Holden stands poised on the
cliff separating childhood from adulthood. His inability to successfully negotiate
the chasm leaves him on the verge of emotional collapse.Read anin-depth analysis of Holden Caulfield.
