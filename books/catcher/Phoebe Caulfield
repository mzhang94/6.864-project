 Phoebe is Holdens ten-year-old sister, whom he loves
dearly. Although she is six years younger than Holden, she listens
to what he says and understands him more than most other people
do. Phoebe is intelligent, neat, and a wonderful dancer, and her childish

throughout the novel. At times, she exhibits great maturity and
even chastises Holden for his immaturity. Like Mr. Antolini, Phoebe
seems to recognize that Holden is his own worst enemy.Read anin-depth analysis of Phoebe Caulfield.
