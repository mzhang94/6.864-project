roommate at Pencey Prep. Stradlater is handsome, self-satisfied,
and popular, but Holden calls him a secret slob, because he appears
well groomed, but his toiletries, such as his razor, are disgustingly unclean.
Stradlater is sexually active and quite experienced for a prep school
student, which is why Holden also calls him a sexy bastard.
