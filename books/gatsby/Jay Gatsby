                The
title character and protagonist of the novel, Gatsby is a fabulously
wealthy young man living in a Gothic mansion in West Egg. He is
famous for the lavish parties he throws every Saturday night, but
no one knows where he comes from, what he does, or how he made his
fortune. As the novel progresses, Nick learns that Gatsby was born
James Gatz on a farm in North Dakota; working for a millionaire
made him dedicate his life to the achievement of wealth. When he
met Daisy while training to be an officer in Louisville, he fell in
love with her. Nick also learns that Gatsby made his fortune through
criminal activity, as he was willing to do anything to gain the
social position he thought necessary to win Daisy. Nick views Gatsby
as a deeply flawed man, dishonest and vulgar, whose extraordinary
optimism and power to transform his dreams into reality make him
great nonetheless.Read anin-depth analysis of Jay Gatsby.
