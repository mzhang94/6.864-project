                 Daisys
immensely wealthy husband, once a member of Nicks social club at
Yale. Powerfully built and hailing from a socially solid old family,
Tom is an arrogant, hypocritical bully. His social attitudes are laced
with racism and sexism, and he never even considers trying to live
up to the moral standard he demands from those around him. He has
no moral qualms about his own extramarital affair with Myrtle, but
when he begins to suspect Daisy and Gatsby of having an affair,
he becomes outraged and forces a confrontation.
