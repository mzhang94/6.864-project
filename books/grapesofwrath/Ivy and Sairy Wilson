 A couple traveling to California whom the Joads
meet on Highway 66, just before Grampas death.
The Wilsons lend the Joads their tent so that Grampa can have a
comfortable place to die. The Joads return the couples kindness
by fixing their broken-down car. Hoping to make the trip easier,
the two families combine forces, traveling together until Sairy Wilsons
health forces her and Ivy to stop.
