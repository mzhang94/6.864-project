older brother. Noah has been slightly deformed since his birth:
Pa Joad had to perform the delivery and, panicking, tried to pull
him out forcibly. Slow and quiet, Noah leaves his family behind
at a stream near the California border, telling Tom that he feels
his parents do not love him as much as they love the other children.
