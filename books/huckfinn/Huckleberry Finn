 The protagonist and narrator of the novel. Huck is
the thirteen-year-old son of the local drunk of St. Petersburg,
Missouri, a town on the Mississippi River. Frequently forced to
survive on his own wits and always a bit of an outcast, Huck is
thoughtful, intelligent (though formally uneducated), and willing to
come to his own conclusions about important matters, even if these
conclusions contradict societys norms. Nevertheless, Huck is still
a boy, and is influenced by others, particularly by his imaginative friend,
Tom.
