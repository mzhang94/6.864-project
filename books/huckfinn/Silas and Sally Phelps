 Tom Sawyers aunt and uncle, whom Huck coincidentally
encounters in his search for Jim after the con men have sold him.
Sally is the sister of Toms aunt, Polly. Essentially good people,
the Phelpses nevertheless hold Jim in custody and try to return
him to his rightful owner. Silas and Sally are the unknowing victims
of many of Tom and Hucks preparations as they try to free Jim.
The Phelpses are the only intact and functional family in this novel,
yet they are too much for Huck, who longs to escape their sivilizing influence.
