 A family that takes Huck in after a steamboat hits
his raft, separating him from Jim. The kindhearted Grangerfords,
who offer Huck a place to stay in their tacky country home, are
locked in a long-standing feud with another local family, the Shepherdsons.
Twain uses the two families to engage in some rollicking humor and
to mock a overly romanticizes ideas about family honor. Ultimately,
the families sensationalized feud gets many of them killed.
