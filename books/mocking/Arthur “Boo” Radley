 A recluse who never sets foot outside his house,
Boo dominates the imaginations of Jem, Scout, and Dill. He is a
powerful symbol of goodness swathed in an initial shroud of creepiness,
leaving little presents for Scout and Jem and emerging at an opportune moment
to save the children. An intelligent child emotionally damaged by
his cruel father, Boo provides an example of the threat that evil
poses to innocence and goodness. He is one of the novels mockingbirds, a
good person injured by the evil 
of mankind.
