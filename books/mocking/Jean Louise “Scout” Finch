 The narrator and protagonist of the story. Scout
lives with her father, Atticus, her brother, Jem, and their black
cook, Calpurnia, in Maycomb. She is intelligent and, by the standards
of her time and place, a tomboy. Scout has a combative streak and
a basic faith in the goodness of the people in her community. As
the novel progresses, this faith is tested by the hatred and prejudice
that emerge during Tom Robinsons trial. Scout eventually develops
a more grown-up perspective that enables her to appreciate human
goodness without ignoring 
human evil.
