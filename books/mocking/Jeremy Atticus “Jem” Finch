 Scouts brother and constant playmate at the beginning
of the story. Jem is something of a typical American boy, refusing
to back down from dares and fantasizing about playing football.
Four years older than Scout, he gradually separates himself from
her games, but he remains her close companion and protector throughout
the novel. Jem moves into adolescence during the story, and his
ideals are shaken badly by the evil and injustice that he perceives
during the trial of Tom Robinson.
