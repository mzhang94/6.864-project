 Governor Bellingham is a wealthy, elderly gentleman
who spends much of his time consulting with the other town fathers.
Despite his role as governor of a fledgling American society, he
very much resembles a traditional English aristocrat. Bellingham tends
to strictly adhere to the rules, but he is easily swayed by Dimmesdales
eloquence. He remains blind to the misbehaviors taking place in
his own house: his sister, Mistress Hibbins, is a witch.
