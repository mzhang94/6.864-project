 Mistress Hibbins is a widow who lives with her brother,
Governor Bellingham, in a luxurious mansion. She is commonly known
to be a witch who ventures into the forest at night to ride with
the Black Man. Her appearances at public occasions remind the
reader of the hypocrisy and hidden evil in Puritan society.
