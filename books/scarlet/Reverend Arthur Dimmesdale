 Dimmesdale is a young man who achieved fame in England
as a theologian and then emigrated to America. In a moment of weakness,
he and Hester became lovers. Although he will not confess it publicly,
he is the father of her child. He deals with his guilt by tormenting
himself physically and psychologically, developing a heart condition
as a result. Dimmesdale is an intelligent and emotional man, and
his sermons are thus masterpieces of eloquence and persuasiveness.
His commitments to his congregation are in constant conflict with
his feelings of sinfulness and need to confess.
