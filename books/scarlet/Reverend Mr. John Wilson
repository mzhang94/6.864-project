 Bostons elder clergyman, Reverend Wilson is scholarly
yet grandfatherly. He is a stereotypical Puritan father, a literary
version of the stiff, starkly painted portraits of American patriarchs. Like
Governor Bellingham, Wilson follows the communitys rules strictly
but can be swayed by Dimmesdales eloquence. Unlike Dimmesdale,
his junior colleague, Wilson preaches hellfire and damnation and
advocates harsh punishment of sinners.
