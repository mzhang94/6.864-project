                Toms
aunt and guardian. Aunt Polly is a simple, kindhearted woman who
struggles to balance her 
love for her nephew with her duty to discipline him. She generally
fails in her attempts to keep Tom 
under control because, although she worries about Toms safety,
she seems to fear constraining him too much. Above all, Aunt Polly
wants to be appreciated and loved.
