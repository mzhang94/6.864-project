                Toms
bosom friend and frequent playmate. Joe is a typical best friend,
a convention Twain parodies when he refers to Joe and Tom as two
souls with but a single thought. Though Joe mostly mirrors Tom,
he diverges from Toms example when he is the first of the boys
to succumb to homesickness on Jacksons Island. As the novel progresses,
Huck begins to assume Joes place as Toms companion.
